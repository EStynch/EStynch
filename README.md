### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Erik Stynchula!

A dedicated software engineer with a core focus creating intuitive user-friendly applications using React, TypeScript, Jest, and Tailwind CSS. I am always seeking to improve my existing skills and expand into other technologies. Currently I am broadening my understanding of: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Kubernetes, KEDA, Docker, and Next.js. My goal is to deliver solutions in a timely manner while also exceeding the expectations of clients and users alike.
