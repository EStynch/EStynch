### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I am Erik Stynchula!

A dedicated software engineer with a core focus creating intuitive user-friendly applications using React, JavaScript, Node.js, and NoSQL. I thrive when immersing myself in new technologies - currently my direct focus is targeting: Svelte, Vue, and Next.js. Next.js is the most exciting because I want to be able to utilize the Automatic Static Optimization and the overall improved SEO.
